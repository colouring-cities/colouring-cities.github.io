## What is the CCRP and why is it needed? 

The Colouring Cities Research Programme (CCRP) is a collaborative, open knowledge research initiative, designed to drive a step-change in the availability of spatial data on national building stocks. 

This is done through a network of Colouring Cities platforms/databases which provide access to, and visualise, open spatial data on stock composition, operation, and dynamic behaviour. Data are collected to improve stock quality, efficiency, sustainability and resilience, accelerate the move to net zero, and support United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals.  Platforms are research-led, and managed by academic institutions at country level but also facilitate the co-creation of visualisations and databases, with government, industry, the third sector, and citizens. All code and data produced by CCRP platforms are released under open licences. CCRP core code, and additional country specific code, are released under a GNU General Public License via GitHub. CCRP building attribute datasets are released via individual international platforms under an Open Data Commons Open Database License, and the CCRP Open Manual released under an MIT License.

Building stocks are the most significant socio-cultural and economic resource of cities and their largest capital asset. They are where we spend most of our lives and impact on our happiness, health, wellbeing and financial security, as well as the quality, safety, efficiency, sustainability and economic vitality of the places in which we live and work. Buildings and built infrastructure are also responsible for almost 40% of global energy-related carbon emissions and 50% of all extracted materials (UNFCC, 2023).

Though information on building characteristics have always been relevance housing, planning, construction,  conservation and taxation,  growth in demand for related data is largely being driven by the need to reduce energy and emissions, and address building vulnerability in the context of climate change.  However, in many countries spatial, and spatiotemporal data, at building level, is extremely hard to obtain, being often highly fragmented across sectors and disciplines, restricted, charged for, unavailable, and/or only available in aggregated form. Building attribute data are also not generally standardised across countries, limiting comparative analysis, and the potential of AI and ML to gain critical insights into the operation of urban areas, at national and global scale.

## How is the CCRP managed and funded? 

The CCRP works to advance a more efficient, whole-of-society approach to knowledge sharing on buildings and cities, at local, national and global scale. To do this it combines a trusted academic framework and research-led approach, with a voluntarily distributed management system, and an open data model. It then uses this resulting structure to collect, share and standardised data on buildings, within and across countries, minimising costs of data sourcing and use for researchers and driving innovation in building stock research through multidisciplinary, research collaborations.

The Colouring Cities Research Programme is hosted by The Alan Turing Institute in the UK, with platform prototype development previously undertaken at The Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis at University College between 2014 and 2019. Turing funds a full time PI and half time research software engineer to oversee the CCRP GitHub core code repository, release of 6 monthly code revisions, the CCRP open manual, the CCRP impact study showcase, CCRP protocols and ethical framework, onboarding of academic partners, chairing of the CCRP International Academic Steering Group. Turing also tests new platform features as part of Colouring Britain’s development in collaboration with Loughborough University, and with advice from the CCRP’s regional university network in the UK. 

CCRP strategy is developed by Turing in close collaboration with the CCRP Global Region leads,  all of whom are members of the CCRP Academic Steering Group. Hubs have been initiated: for North America by Concordia University (Canada), for Europe by the Leibniz Institute of Ecological Urban and Regional Development Research Data Centre (Germany),  for the Middle East by the University of Bahrain, for Latin America by St Andrew’s University and the Universidad Distrital - Francisco Jose de Caldas (Colombia), for Africa by Dedan Kimathi University of Technology (Kenya) and for the Asia Pacific region by the University of New South Wales and King’s College London. Hub leads help drive network expansion and knowledge sharing at regional level and chair bimonthly meetings. Platform content and CCRP network development strategy is also advised by the CCRP’s expert groups, who focus on specific CCRP data categories, and by national research bodies including Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the US. Academic partners also benefit from monthly CCRP international software engineering meetings, run by Concordia University, support in platform repository set up from Turing and free network workshops and talks.

Colouring Cities platforms and databases are designed to be sustainable, resilient,  interoperable and permanent, and to improve over time. They are also designed to be incrementally, at low cost, in line with institution’s research goals, and to then be slowly enriched, year-on-year. by researchers  students, citizens, government, industry and the voluntary sector.  

All Colouring Cities platforms are assigned to a Global Region Hub to provide an immediate, helpful support network. Each participating country is set up with a GitHub repository by Turing and offered guidance on using the CCRP’s open source code. Each is managed independently by the university or university consortia leading in each country. Academic leads agree (informally) to work towards CCRP goals, follow CCRP protocols, codes of conduct and branding and to set up a demo platform with a longer term view to national database management.  Initial demos for a city or town are recommended to be carried out as part of existing research programmes, working with PhD research software engineers wherever possible, rather than build these using significant new funding. Platforms that are embedded as core resources by academic leads at an early stage, have been found to be more sustainable and successful than those that rely on dedicated grants. However, once demos have been built and embedded, they can then be used to help lever research funding.  Platforms have been specifically designed to be able to be managed at low cost alongside other core university resources. 

All Colouring platforms/databases are run by researchers who require building attribute for their research. Collaborations between planning, energy and or built environment, and computer science faculties, (across or within universities) faculties are recommended, as is the incremental development of national academic partners interested in supporting data upload at country region or city level. Initial partners are recommended to begin setting up an informal network of universities across the country interested in helping add to the database, and in helping to involve diverse sectors at regional scale, in contributing data. This enables the Colouring platform lead/s to concentrate on managing and improving the database and working with the Global Region Hub, and shares costs of adding data. 

The CCRP is also designed to provide a welcoming and stimulating and inclusive space for researchers interested in open knowledge systems and building data to co-work on the CCRP system to help accelerate complex problem solving at national and global level.

## How do Colouring platforms work

Colouring Cities platforms collect, collate, verify, visualise and release microspatial building attribute data, on building characteristics, building performance, and the short and long-term dynamic behaviour of building stocks. Four main methods of data capture and upload to platforms is explored:  Open bulk uploads/APIs moderated by academia; crowdsourcing at building level with each vectorised footprints able to be ‘coloured in’ live; streaming of official data using APIs, and computational approaches including AI, ML and simulation. Data accuracy is maximised through the ongoing testing and improvement of feedback loops between the methods, verification tools, and by providing information on collection method used, and uncertainty quantification (planned).  This multipronged approach is also necessary to encourage knowledge exchange across diverse sectors, disciplines and communities.

Platforms are designed to ask basic questions such as How many buildings do we have? What type of building are they? What are they used for?  Made of? How old are they?  How repairable, adaptable and extendable? How much longer might they last? How energy efficient are they? How suitable for retrofit and have they been retrofitted? What is their green context? Thier planning and protection status? Their relationship to the street? Who built them? What type of ownership? How well do local communities think they work and what impact does their presence or loss have on us and our physical landscapes in environmental, economic and socio-cultural terms. 

<img width="1429" alt="Screenshot 2024-07-01 at 12 02 36" src="https://github.com/colouring-cities/colouring-cities.github.io/assets/42236514/673bab2f-17bc-4c9f-a958-199a1e47e63e">

Over 150 classes of standardised spatial data are integrated. These are contained within the following 12 CCRP categories:  Building location and ID, Land activity, Building Type & form, Size, Construction and materials, Age & History, Street Context, Planning Context and protection, Energy Performance, Resilience/Live disaster management, and Community value. Data on other built, and green, infrastructure is also being explored). 

Geolocated building footprints operate as mini filing cabinets able to capture, collate, verify, release,  and also visualise the spatial data, as well as providing information on building form and size. Since 2024 CCRP voluntary international expert groups have begun to be formed for all 12 CCRP main data categories. These recommend changes and additions to standardised CCRP data classes which are then reflected in the CCRP core repository.  and to deciding which classes should be standardised to allow for analysis across countries.

CCCP partners use identical interfaces and logos and core data classes to maximise interoperability of systems, to maintain programme and platform quality, and to maximise user trust. No other applications of Colouring Cities open code are endorsed by the CCRP or The Alan Turing Institute outside the CCRP GitHub site.
This is important as reuse of code is actively encouraged. Clear visual branding is also necessary to allow the purpose, principles, and quality of CCRP platforms to be instantly understood regardless of which country a Colouring Cities platform is operating in.  Where platforms differ is in additional subcategory inclusion specific to national or regional contexts.
