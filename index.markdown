## Overview

The Colouring Cities Research Programme (CCRP) designs and tests open-source tools that facilitate knowledge and data sharing on national building stocks. The CCRP is managed by the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/about-us), the UK's National Institute of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, and is being developed in collaboration with international academic institutions across ten countries.

[Alan Turing](https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/what-alan-turing-means-us), mathematician and computer science pioneer argued that "_the isolated individual does not develop any intellectual power  â€¦The search for new techniques must be regarded as carried out by the human community as a whole, rather than by individuals_".  
The CCRP programme works to bring together knowledge, held within communities, academia, industry, government and the third sector - and across science, technology, the humanities and the arts, to help solve complex urban problems. It does this by supporting the co-creation and co-management of research-led, networked, open data platforms that visualise data, at building level, on the composition, performance, and dynamic behaviour of national building stocks.

Colouring Cities platforms are designed to:
* effect a step change in the range and scale of spatial building attribute data freely available at building level, relevant to socio-economic and environmental research, urban management and sustainable building practice;
* increase the quality of building attribute data, necessary to improve the quality, sustainability, efficiency and resilience of stocks, in line with the United Nations' [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) and its [New Urban Agenda](https://habitat3.org/the-new-urban-agenda/);
* test and integrate a range of data capture methods, including computational approaches, crowdsourcing and live streaming, and feedback loops between these, to support interdisciplinary work and engagement of diverse stakeholders to maximise data richness, accuracy, granularity, range and geographic cover;
* test an academic governance model for networked, low-cost, independently managed open data platforms allowing standardised building level data to be shared across cities and countries;
* advance discussion on ethical issues relating to the capture and release of building attribute data, and promote ethical, inclusive, reproducible, and collaborative data science, as laid out in [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/index.html).

The CCRP is a branded research programme that enables international academic institutions to pool knowledge and resources, and co-develop and test open-source code for Colouring Cities open data platforms. Over 50 academics currently collaborate on the project. CCRP platforms are independently managed by academic partners at country level and follow an agreed set of [protocols](https://github.com/colouring-cities/manual/wiki/F2.-PROTOCOLS,-codes-of-conduct-&-data-sharing-agreements). Partners also oversee the development of collaborative maintenance frameworks for databases (as used in Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap) encouraging engagement from academia, government, industry, the third sector and citizens. CCRP core code, and additional country specific code, are released under a GNU General Public License via GitHub. CCRP building attribute datasets are released via individual international platforms under an Open Data Commons Open Database License, and the CCRP Open Manual released under an MIT License.

Colouring Cities platforms use digital building footprints - of the highest quality, openness and geographic cover available within each country - as their basic building block. As well as providing information on the shape and size of buildings, footprints act as mini filing cabinets allowing information to be easily captured, collated, verified and visualised. Live co-creation of beautiful maps through the colouring-in of footprints by community collaborators forms a key feature of platform design. The CCRP looks to harness as much information on buildings as possible from professionals involved in their design, construction, management, monitoring, conservation, and retrofitting, from citizens and civic societies, and from diverse academic disciplines and research programmes. Disciplines represented by CCRP academic partners include: data science, computer science, software engineering, urban science, industrial ecology, urban morphology, physics, environmental science, material science, climate change & resilience studies, building construction, engineering, conservation, housing, planning, architecture, history, architectural history, graphic design and colour theory, open data systems and principles, data ethics, artificial intelligence (including machine learning & computer vision), procedural modelling, GIS and spatial data visualisation. Ethical use of building level footprints and the identification of security and privacy concerns relating to the visualisation and release of building attribute data form key areas of CCRP work.

CCRP categories are visually grouped into a 12 category grid, which doubles as the CCRP logo, to maximise accessibility. Each Colouring Cities platform is designed to collect, collate, visualise, verify, enrich and release over 100 standardised subcategories of spatial building attribute data.  Selection of subcategories is based on analysis of academic papers relating to sustainability science, urban science, resilience analysis and urban complexity, UK stakeholder consultation on the Colouring London prototype (2015-19), international partner consultation, and live platform testing. New subcategories are added in consultation with CCRP academic partners and each risk assessed in terms of potential negative impact of collection on building occupiers. Four data capture methods are experimented with: bulk upload of open public datasets, live streaming from public sources, computational generation using inference, and crowdsourcing from citizens and professional at building level. Through this process issues such as data fragmentation, incompleteness, inaccessibility, aggregation, inconsistency, security and privacy are explored and addressed. Data accuracy is maximised through feedback loops between data capture methods, and use of verification tools.

## CCRP academic partners/platform hosts

The CCRP is a research-led programme comprised of an informal consortium of academic partners with similar research interests and values. The CCRP works to provide a welcoming and stimulating space in which ideas and data can be shared. As well as operating within ethical frameworks set by individual research institutions, all CCRP partners sign up to its ethical framework and  protocols. CCCP partners use identical interfaces and main data category keypads to maximise clarity and interoperability of systems, to maintain programme and platform quality, and to maximise user trust. This is particularly important as software developer/engineers are actively encouraged to experiment with CCRP open code, and data are released with permission for third party use. Clear visual branding is also necessary to allow the purpose, principles, and quality of CCRP platforms to be instantly understood regardless of which country a Colouring Cities platform is operating in.  Where platforms differ is in additional subcategory inclusion relevant to national/regional contexts. 

CCRP academic partners can be identified by their inclusion on this page, and on the [Alan Turing Institute CCRP webpage](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/colouring-london-and-colouring-cities-research-programme).  No other applications of Colouring Cities code, interface design or logo are endorsed by the Alan Turing Institute. Information on CCRP resources provided by The Alan Turing Institute can be found [here](https://github.com/colouring-cities/manual/wiki/B.-CCRP-INTERNATIONAL-RESEARCH-PARTNERS-;-links,-resources,-protocols-&-meeting-dates).

## **Academic networks and hubs**
As the number of countries involved in the CCRP is expanding, self-managing CCRP Global Region Hubs (GRHs) are beginning to be set-up and co-ordinated by interested academic partners/academic consortia. This helps maximise support for new research teams coming on board,  and stimulates regional interdisciplinary collaboration. The four initial GRHs are as follows:
* The Americas 
* Africa and the Middle East
* Asia & Australasia
* Europe
We are particularly keen to hear from academic institutions in Africa, Central America and North Asia interested in testing CCRP code as we are yet to have representation within these global regions.
