## Overview

The Colouring Cities Research Programme (CCRP) designs and tests open-source tools that facilitate knowledge and data sharing on the composition, performance, and dynamic behaviour of national building stocks. The CCRP is run by the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/about-us), the UK's National Institute of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, whose purpose is to make great leaps in data science and artificial intelligence (AI) research to change the world for the better. 

[Alan Turing](https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/what-alan-turing-means-us) argued that "_the isolated individual does not develop any intellectual power  …The search for new techniques must be regarded as carried out by the human community as a whole, rather than by individuals_".  The CCRP programme brings together sectors, communities and countries, working in science and technology, the humanities and the arts, to help solve complex urban problems through the co-development of visual open data platfoms on building stocks.

The CCRP looks to harness as much information on buildings as possible from professionals involved in their design, construction, management, monitoring, conservation, and retrofitting, from citizens and civic societies, and from diverse academic disciplines and research programmes. It also brings together international academic institutions, undertaking research into building stock sustainability and resilience, to co-work on platform design.  Disciplines represented by CCRP academic partners include: data science, computer science and software engineering, urban science, industrial ecology, urban morphology, physics, environmental science, material science, climate change & resilience studies, building construction, engineering, conservation, housing, planning, architecture, history, architectural history, graphic design and colour theory, open data systems and principles, data ethics, artificial intelligence (including machine learning & computer vision), procedural modelling, the mathematics of cities, GIS and spatial data visualisation.

Colouring Cities platforms are designed to:
* effect a step change in the range, scale, quality and accessibility of spatial building attribute data, at building level, for use in socio-economic and environmental research, and in sustainable building practice;
* increase access to data necessary to improve stock quality, sustainability, efficiency and resilience in line with the [United Nations' [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) and [New Urban Agenda](https://habitat3.org/the-new-urban-agenda/);
* increase access to data at global scale to exploit the potential of AI to gain rapid insights into the stock as a complex dynamic system;
* test an academic governance model for a network of low-cost, interoperable, but independently managed, open data platfoms whose standardised, building level datasets allow for comparative analysis of stocks across countries;
* test diverse methods of data capture, and feedback loops, to engage diverse stakeholders -whethe from industry, academia, government, the third sector, or citizens- to maximise the data richness, accuracy, granularity, range and geographic cover; 
* advance ethical, reproducible, and collaborative data science, as set out in [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.htmlsupport.

The CCRP is a branded research programme that enables international academic institutions involved in building stock research, and research software engineering, to pool knowledge, and co-develop and test open-source code for Colouring Cities platforms. Each CCRP platform is managed and funded independently by academic partners at country level, and follows an agreed set of [CCRP protocols](https://github.com/colouring-cities/manual/wiki/B.-International-research-partners;-links,-resources,-protocols-&-meeting-dates) drafted by the Alan Turing Institute. Stakeholder networks are developed within countries to maximise efficiency of data upload, updating and verification using a collaborative maintenance model - as pioneered by the open data movement. The CCRP releases its core code, and additional country specific code, under a GNU General Public License via GitHub. Its building attribute datasets are accessible via its international platform network under an Open Data Commons Open Database License. It's Open Manual is released under an MIT License.

Colouring Cities platforms collect, collate, visualise, verify, enrich and release over 120 categories of spatial building attribute data. These are grouped into 12 subject areas, as shown below. Selection of subcategories is based on analysis of academic papers relating to sustainability science, urban science, resilience analysis and urban complexity, UK stakeholder consultation on the Colouring London prototype (2015-19), international partner consultation and live platform testing. New subcategories are added in consultation with CCRP academic partners. Four data capture methods are experimented with: bulk upload of open public datasets, live streaming from public sources, computational generation using inference and crowdsourcing at building level. Through this process issues such as data fragmentation, incompleteness, inaccessibility, aggregation,inconsistency, security and privacy are explored and addressed. Data accuracy is maximised through feedback loops between data capture methods, and verification tools.

Colouring Cities platforms use building footprints, of the highest quality, openness and geographic coverage available within each country, as their basic building block. As well as providing information on the shape and size of buildings, footprints act as mini filing cabinets, allowing information to be easily captured, collated, verified and visualised. Live co-creation of maps through the colouring-in of footprints forms a key feature of platform design.

## **Academic networks and hubs**
As the number of countries involved in the CCRP expands, Global Region Hubs will be set-up to bring together and support discussion between academic institutions testing Colouring Cities platforms, and to help to encourage and track use of CCRP data in socio-economic and environmental research. Three hubs, operating within similar time zones, are proposed:
* North, Central & South America
* Europe & the Middle East
* Asia & Australasia

## **CCRP Quality control and platform interoperability**
CCRP branding is tightly controlled to maintain programme and platform quality, and to maximise user trust. Branding is also important as platform code is open-source, with experimentation by software developers and engineers encouraged. The CCRP provides the necessary space to allow international research partners to co-design and test platforms to the highest standards, to explore the potential value of captured building attribute data in many areas of socio-economic and environmental reseach, and to ensure ethical considerations are prioritised. Clear branding is also necessary to allow the purpose, principles, and quality and of Colouring Cities platforms to be instantly understood regardless of which country a Colouring Cities platform is set up in. Improvements to interface design and content are ongoing and incremental, building on findings from the CCRP group. CCCP partners use identical interfaces and main data category keypads to maximise clarity and interoperability of systems. Where platforms differ is in additional subcategory inclusion relevant to national/regional contexts, open-source code for which is also available within the CCRP GitHub repository. 

CCRP research partners can be identified by their exclusive use of the Colouring Cities logo, and their inclusion on this page, and n the [Alan Turing Institute CCRP webpage](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/colouring-london-and-colouring-cities-research-programme).  No other applications of Colouring Cities code, interface design or logo are endorsed by the Alan Turing Institute. Information on CCRP resources provided by The Alan Turing Insititute and Academic Partner Protocols can be found [here](https://github.com/colouring-cities/manual/wiki/B.-CCRP-INTERNATIONAL-RESEARCH-PARTNERS-;-links,-resources,-protocols-&-meeting-dates).
