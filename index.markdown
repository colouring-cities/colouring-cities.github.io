## What is the CCRP and why is it needed? 
The Colouring Cities Research Programme (CCRP) is a collaborative, open knowledge research initiative, set up to drive a step-change in availability of spatial data on the global building stock to support national sustainable development programmes in the context of United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals. This is done through a network of Colouring Cities platforms which provide spatial data on the composition, operation, and the dynamic behaviour of building stocks. These are managed by academia but co-built with government, industry, the third sector, and by citizens work  to help improve stock quality, efficiency, sustainability and resilience across countries and accelerate net zero goals.

Building stocks are the most significant socio-cultural and economic resource of cities and their largest capital asset. Buildings are where we spend most of our lives and they impact on our happiness, health, wellbeing and financial security, and on the quality, safety and economic vitality of the places in which we live and work. Buildings and built infrastructure are also responsible for almost 40% of global energy-related carbon emissions and 50% of all extracted materials (UNFCC, 2023).

Though spatial data on building stocks is relevant to housing, planning and property development, heritage, health, and many other areas, increased demand for this over recent decades has been driven by the urgent need to reduce energy and emissions, and to address building vulnerability in the context of climate change.  However, in many countries spatial and spatiotemporal data on buildings, at building level, is extremely hard to obtain; often being highly fragmented across sectors and disciplines, restricted, charged for, unavailable, and/or only available in aggregated form. Building attribute data are also not generally standardised across countries, limiting the speed of knowledge exchange and cross country analysis and  use of AI and ML to gain important insights, at national and global scale.

## Who’s involved in the CCRP and how does it work? 
The CCRP oversees a global network of interoperable Colouring Cities open data platforms/spatial databases which are each managed independently by academic partners at country level. The informal academic consortium is led by The Alan Turing Institute, with strategy developed in collaboration the CCRP’s voluntary International Academic Steering Group, members of which also provide support and advice through CCRP Global Region Hubs. Technical meetings are run by Concordia University. All Colouring Cities platforms follow CCRP protocols, as well as academic protocols specific to participating institutions and are at different stages of development. Each can be developed at the institution’s pace in line with its research goals. All code and data produced by CCRP platforms are released under open licences. CCRP core code, and additional country specific code, are released under a GNU General Public License via GitHub. CCRP building attribute datasets are released via individual international platforms under an Open Data Commons Open Database License, and the CCRP Open Manual released under an MIT License.

The programme is designed to be highly flexible, to be built incrementally and to provide  open resources of national relevance and  long-term value, as well those critical to accelerating many areas of urban and energy related research.  The CCRP also works to advance a more efficient, whole-of-society approach to knowledge sharing on buildings and cities, and database maintenance, allowing for permanent open databases maintained by academia to be enriched, year-on-year, by citizens, academia, government, industry and the voluntary sector. Live co-creation of beautiful maps through the colouring-in of footprints by community collaborators forms a key feature of platform design.

The Colouring Cities model has been built and successfully tested using this step-by-step collaborative approach with over 100 researchers worldwide since 2016. The CCRP is rapidly expanding with 70 researchers from 20 countries currently involved as part of existing research programmes and CCRP specific grants. Their contributions range from helping extend and promote the CCRP network, building and managing platforms, testing AI and ML approaches, and providing expert advice on areas such as data ethics, data content, core code and platform set up improvement: Current academic collaborators include Australia, University of New South Wales; Austria, AIT and BOKU; Bahrain, University of Bahrain; Britain, Alan Turing Institute and Loughborough University and researchers from the universities of Birmingham, Bristol, Newcastle, Exeter, Manchester, Oxford, Cambridge and UCL; Canada, Concordia University; Colombia, Universidad di San Jose; Germany, Leibniz Institute of Ecological Urban and Regional Development (IOER, Research Data Centre, IOER);  Greece University of Patras, and National Technical University of Athens;  Hungary (); Indonesia, King’s College London and Institut Teknologi Bandung; Kenya, Dedan Kimathi University of Technology; Lebanon, American University of Beirut); Philippines ; Ateneo de Manila University; Poland; Poznan University of Technology;  Singapore,  National University of Singapore;  Switzerland EPFL Lausanne; Spain, IREC;  Sweden, Mälardalen University; Turkey (Istanbul Technical University) and the United States, City University New York, Perelman School of Medicine, Penn University  and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. 

Multidisciplinary expertise within the CCRP includes: computer science, data science, software engineering, urban science, industrial ecology, urban morphology, physics, environmental science, material science, climate change, resilience and risk, building construction, engineering, conservation, housing, health, planning, architecture, history, architectural history, graphic design, colour theory, open data systems, AI, (including Machine learning and computer vision), procedural modelling, GIS and spatial data visualisation and uncertainty quantification. Data ethics and ethical use of building level footprints and the identification of security and privacy concerns relating to the visualisation and release of building attribute data form key areas of CCRP work.

## How do Colouring Cities platforms work?
Colouring Cities platforms collect and release microspatial building attribute data, on building characteristics, building performance, and the short and long-term dynamic behaviour of building stocks. 

Platforms are designed to ask basic questions such as How many buildings do we have? What type of building are they? What are they used for?  Made of? How old are they?  How repairable, adaptable and extendable? How much longer might they last? How energy efficient are they? How suitable for retrofit and have they been retrofitted? What is their green context? Their relationship to the street? Who built them? What type of ownership? How well do local communities think they work and what impact does their presence or loss have on us and our physical landscapes in environmental, economic and socio-cultural terms. 

<img width="1429" alt="Screenshot 2024-07-01 at 12 02 36" src="https://github.com/colouring-cities/colouring-cities.github.io/assets/42236514/8c2fc034-d766-45ca-a830-86ba8e6f9bad">

Over 150 classes of standardised spatial data are integrated. These are contained within the following 12 CCRP categories:  Building location and ID, Land activity, Building Type & form, Size, Construction and materials, Age & History, Street Context, Planning Context and protection, Energy Performance, Resilience/Live disaster management, and Community value. Data on other built, and green, infrastructure is also being explored). Geolocated building footprints operate as mini filing cabinets able to capture, collate, verify, release,  and also visualise the spatial data, as well as providing information on building form and size. Since 2024 CCRP voluntary international expert groups have begun to be formed for all 12 CCRP main data categories. These recommend changes and additions to standardised CCRP data classes which are then reflected in the CCRP core repository.  and to deciding which classes should be standardised to allow for analysis across countries.

CCCP partners use identical interfaces and logos and core data classes to maximise interoperability of systems, to maintain programme and platform quality, and to maximise user trust. This is particularly important as software developer/engineers are actively encouraged to experiment with CCRP open source code on GitHub, and data are released with permission for third party use. Clear visual branding is also necessary to allow the purpose, principles, and quality of CCRP platforms to be instantly understood regardless of which country a Colouring Cities platform is operating in.  Where platforms differ is in additional subcategory inclusion specific to national or regional contexts. No other applications of Colouring Cities open code are endorsed by the CCRP or The Alan Turing Institute outside the CCRP GitHub site.

Four main methods of data capture and upload to platforms is explored:  Open bulk uploads/APIs moderated by academia; crowdsourcing at building level with each vectorised footprints able to be ‘coloured in’ live; streaming of official data using APIs, and computational approaches including AI, ML and simulation. Data accuracy is maximised through the ongoing testing and improvement of feedback loops between the methods, verification tools, and by providing information on collection method used, and uncertainty quantification (planned).  This multipronged approach is also necessary to encourage knowledge exchange across diverse sectors, disciplines and communities.

## What is the main purpose of globally networked Colouring Cities platforms?

* To effect a step change in the range and scale of spatial building attribute data freely available at building level, relevant to socio-cultural, economic and environmental research, urban management and sustainable building practice worldwide;

* To address data and knowledge fragmentation in relation to building stocks and issues such as data fragmentation, incompleteness, quality, inaccessibility, reliability, aggregation, inconsistency, security and privacy. To do this through mechanisms that facilitate knowledge and data sharing across sectors, disciplines and communities;

* To increase the quality of building attribute data, necessary to improve the quality, sustainability, efficiency and resilience of stocks, in line with the United Nations' [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) and its [New Urban Agenda](https://habitat3.org/the-new-urban-agenda/);

* To test and integrate a range of data capture methods, including computational approaches; crowdsourcing and live streaming, and feedback loops between these, to support interdisciplinary work and engagement of diverse stakeholders to maximise data richness, accuracy, granularity, range and geographic cover;

* To advance discussion on ethical issues relating to the capture and release of building attribute data, and promote ethical, inclusive, reproducible, and collaborative data science, as laid out in [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/index.html). * 

* To provide the scale and quality of spatiotemporal data required to facilitate the use AI and machine learning, and the development of digital twins and simulations, to accelerate the move to net zero and to increase resilience in stocks and better understand  the stock as a dynamic system;

* To test an academic governance model for networked, low-cost, independently managed open data platforms allowing standardised building level data to be shared across cities and countries;

## CCRP’s management system work? 

The CCRP combines a trusted academic framework, a low-cost distributed management system, an open data model, and an informal collaborative ethos in order to accelerate high quality building attribute data release and to increase collaborative work on complex problem solving across countries to improve the quality, efficiency, sustainability and resilience of buildings and urban areas.

The Colouring Cities Research Programme is hosted by The Alan Turing Institute, which oversees GitHub CCRP core code repository and 6 monthly revisions/updates, CCRP open manual editing , the GitHub impact study showcase, reviewing CCRP protocols, onboarding of academic partners, chairing the  CCRP International Academic Steering Group and supporting expert groups. 

The goal is to embed databases within nstitutions at the earliest and allowing seedlings to grow into rich, permanent, multidisciplinary resources of local regional , national and global  value. Each Colouring platform is assigned to a CCRP Global Region Hub. These are run informally by one of more academic partners within each region. Hubs are currently led and developed by IOER (Europe), Bahrain University (Middle East), Concordia University (North America), St Andrew’s University/ Universidad Distrital - Francisco Jose de Caldas (Latin America), Dedan Kimathi University of Technology (Africa) and King’s College London (Asia Pacific). All Global Hub leads are represented on the CCRP’s International Academic Steering Group. 

Monthly CCRP software engineering meetings are run by Concordia University, with expert groups for each category currently being set up; the first being the CCRP Energy group chaired by Mälardalen University.  Online specialist workshops are also able to organised by any CCRP partner. 

Each CCRP national platform is run by an academic lead or academic consortium which manages the database and provides technical oversight. Collaborations between computer science faculties and planning/energy/building environment faculties in the same or different universities is recommended. Public research institutions can request to join the CCRP subject to agreement to adher CCRP protocols. Initial partners are strongly advised to set up informal national scale academic networks, as in the UK , to facilitate this process and maximise high quality data upload and geographic coverage at regional level and support from government, the third sector, industry and citizens.   Demo platforms which are quick to set up can be used to lever support

The CCRP is also designed to provide a welcoming and stimulating space for researchers interested in open knowledge systems, building data to co-work on a single system in order to maximise efficiency and accelerate complex problem solving at national and global level.

## Management History and funding
The CCRP hosting has been funded at the Alan Turing Institute since 2020 by UKRI core funding and by the AI for Science and Government programme. Prototype development was previously undertaken at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London ( 2014 and 2019) and funded as part of doctoral research by the UK’s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, as well by Historic England and Innovate UK.  The CCRP concept of free, multidisciplinary, knowledge exchange centres/systems (physical and digital) designed to improve the sustainability of stocks, collaboratively built by diverse sectors and maintained at low cost, was initially tested by The Building Exploratory charitable trust in London in 1998 within its permanent public exhibition and where the first iteration of the Colouring London was designed and built. All CCRP collaborators provide voluntarily time to support the CCRP in a way that directly benefits their research. All platforms are independently managed and funded through existing programmes or new internal and/or external grants. Demo are generally able to be funded as part of existing research programmes or with PhD help and then used to lever support. Between July 2023 and 2024  CCRP platforms in Indonesia, Canada, Bahrain and Colombia and Sweden all won individual grants.
