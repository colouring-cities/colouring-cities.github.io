 "_the isolated individual does not develop any intellectual power  …The search for new techniques must be regarded as carried out by the human community as a whole, rather than by individuals_". Alan Turing

## What is the CCRP 
The Colouring Cities Research Programme (CCRP) is a research-led open-source,initiative co-developed by a voluntary, international academic research consortium to drive a step-change in access to high quality, standardised, comprehensive microspatial building attribute data.  Its core code repository is currently managed by the Alan Turing Institute (UK). Over 100 researchers worldwide have contributed to the CCRP since 2016 and over 70 researchers from over twenty countries are currently involved in platform and network development and system design. 

CCRP academic partners oversee the set-up and management of interoperable, CCRP open mapping platforms - using CCRP open-source code combined with locally accessed building outline data. Platforms can then be immediately used to collect, collate, visualise, verify, enrich, release  and share open microspatial data on building characteristics, performance, and short and long-term dynamic behaviour. The CCRP network has been designed to extremely agile, with platforms able to be built incrementally, and gradually embedded as core resources as part of existing research programme.  Country level platforms are then grouped within CCRP Global Hubs managed voluntarily by academic partners to facilitate co-working at regional level, and to address time zone differences and rapid programme expansion. These are supported by Turing which also manages the CCRP strategic advisory group (made up Global Hub leads) as well as CCRP expert groups which volunarily chaired by different countries. 

The CCRP also looks to advance a more efficient, whole-of-society approach to knowledge sharing on buildings and cities, allowing for permanent open databases to be collaboratively maintained and enriched, year-on-year, by citizens, academia, government, industry and the voluntary sector. The Colouring Cities model has been built and successfully tested since 2016 using this step-by-step collaborative approach. Diverse approaches to data capture and generation are tested including open bulk uploads/APIs moderated by academia; crowdsourcing at building level, streaming of official data, and computational inference. These are also designed to support diverse stakeholder needs. 

Disciplines represented by CCRP academic partners include: data science, computer science, software engineering, urban science, industrial ecology, urban morphology, physics, environmental science, material science, climate change & resilience studies, building construction, engineering, conservation, housing, planning, architecture, history, architectural history, graphic design and colour theory, open data systems and principles, data ethics, artificial intelligence (including machine learning & computer vision), procedural modelling, GIS and spatial data visualisation. The CCRP aldso looks to harness as much information on buildings as possible from professionals involved in their design, construction, management, monitoring, conservation, and retrofitting, from citizens and civic societies, and from diverse academic disciplines and research programmes. Ethical use of building level footprints and the identification of security and privacy concerns relating to the visualisation and release of building attribute data form key areas of CCRP work.

## Global Hubs and Participating Countries
Current Global Region Hubshave been set up for:  South Asia and Asia Pacific, the Middle east, Africa, Europe, North America and Latin America.
Countries in which there is CCRP academic partner representation are as follows. 


## Mission statement
The CCRP is designed to:
 
* effect a step change in the range and scale of spatial building attribute data freely available at building level, relevant to socio-economic and environmental research, urban management and sustainable building practice;

* create a global open database able to support improvements to the quality, sustainability, efficiency and resilience of urban areas, in line with the United Nations' [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) and its [New Urban Agenda](https://habitat3.org/the-new-urban-agenda/);

* better understand the stock as a complex dynamic system and to accelerate collaborative working on complex problem solving, especially those common to all countries.

* test and integrate a range of data capture methods to support interdisciplinary work and engagement of diverse stakeholders to maximise data richness, accuracy, granularity, range and geographic cover;

* test an academic governance model for networked, low-cost, independently managed open data platforms allowing standardised building level data to be shared across cities and countries;

* advance discussion on ethical issues relating to the capture and release of building attribute data, and promote ethical, inclusive, reproducible, and collaborative data science, as laid out in [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/index.html).

* Facilitate the use AI and machine learning, and the development of digital twins, to accelerate the move to net zero and to increase resilience in stocks;
* Develop ethical frameworks for the collection and application of microspatial building attribute data


## Demand for microspatial building attribute data
Buildings are where we spend most of our lives and most of our money, with building stocks being the most significant socio-cultural and economic resource of cities and their largest capital asset. They impact to everything from our health and wellbeing, and the quality if our homes to the safety and economic vitality of the areas where we live and work. Buildings and built infrastructure are also responsible for almost 40% of global energy-related carbon emissions and 50% of all extracted materials (UNFCC, 2023).

Comprehensive spatial data on the composition, operation, and the dynamic behaviour of building stocks are now urgently required to help diverse stakeholders (from government, academia, industry, the third sector, and citizens) work collectively to accelerate improvements to the quality, efficiency, sustainability and resilience of national stocks and related built infrastructure.How many buildings do we have? What type of building are they? What are they used for and made of? How old are they and how much longer might they last? How repairable, adaptable and extendable are they? How energy efficient are they? What is their green context and their relationship to the street? Who built them? What type of ownership do they have? How well do local communities think they work and what impact can differences, and changes to, buildings and building stocks as a whole, have on our environment, our communities, our economies and our cultural landscape.

However in many countries spatial information on buildings, at building level, is extremely difficult to obtain, often being highly fragmented, restricted, missing, or only available in aggregated form. Spatial data are also rarely standardised across countries making it extremely difficult to exploit advances in computational methods able to provide rapid insights into spatial data patterns and cycles and their implications. The CCRP unique in its development of a global scale, microspatial building attribute database.

## Participants
Institutions currently working with the CCRP are as follows: The University of New South Wales (Colouring Australia), The Leibniz Institute for Ecological Urban and Regional Development (Colouring Germany); CERC Concordia University (Colouring Canada). The American University of Beirut (Colouring Lebanon); The National Technical University of Athens (Colouring Athens); King’s College London & the Institut Teknologi Bandung (Colouring Indonesia), The Universidad Distrital – Francisco Jose de Caldas, Department of Cadastral and Geodesy Engineering (Colouring Colombia) and Mälardalen University (Colouring Sweden); The University of Bahrain & the Bahrain Authority for Culture and Antiquities (Colouring Bahrain) The Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania; The Austrian Institute of Technology and EPFL Lausanne. Owing to growing interest in the CCRP, CCRP Global Region Hubs are now beginning to be developed with academic partners, with the CCRP's European Hub, led by Leibniz institute for Ecological & Urban Regional Development, launched on Januray 19th 2024. The purpose of these Hubs is to encourage and manage wider international participation and to stimulate new interdisciplinary/cross sector research collaborations where existing funding can be pooled and/or new funding applied for. Strategy for hub rollout is developed by the CCRP's International Academic Steering Group. This is an informal group of CCRP academic partners actively involved in hub development. The Group is chaired by the Alan Turing Institute and is currently made up of the City Futures Research Center, University of New South Wales (Colouring Australia/Asia Pacific hub); the Canada Excellence Research Chair in Smart, Sustainable and Resilient Communities and Cities at Concordia University (Colouring Canada/North American hub) and the Research Data Centre at the Leibniz institute for Ecological & Urban Regional Development -IOER Dresden (Colouring Germany/European Hub). Concordia University also chairs the CCRP's monthly international engineering meeting where engineers from partner countries co-work on code. IOER Dresden is leading on the CCRP's 2024 workshop series.

## How CCRP platforms work
Academic partners and each follow a common set of [protocols](https://github.com/colouring-cities/manual/wiki/F2.-PROTOCOLS,-codes-of-conduct-&-data-sharing-agreements). Partners also oversee the development of collaborative maintenance frameworks for databases (as used in Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap) encouraging engagement from academia, government, industry, the third sector and citizens. CCRP core code, and additional country specific code, are released under a GNU General Public License via GitHub. CCRP building attribute datasets are released via individual international platforms under an Open Data Commons Open Database License, and the CCRP Open Manual released under an MIT License.

Colouring Cities platforms use digital building footprints - of the highest quality, openness and geographic cover available within each country - as their basic building block. As well as providing information on the shape and size of buildings, footprints act as mini filing cabinets allowing information to be easily captured, collated, verified and visualised. Live co-creation of beautiful maps through the colouring-in of footprints by community collaborators forms a key feature of platform design. 

CCRP categories are visually grouped into a 12 category grid shown below, to maximise data accessibility for all audience groups.  Attribute selection is based on: analysis of academic literature relating to sustainability science, urban science, resilience analysis and urban complexity; stakeholder and international consultation on the Colouring London prototype (2015-19) and public and stakeholder feedback at UK level following platform testing. New datasets are added/collected in consultation with CCRP academic partners with each assessed for risk of negative impact on building occupiers. Four data capture methods are experimented with: bulk upload of open public datasets, live streaming from public sources, computational generation using inference, and crowdsourcing from citizens and professional at building level. Through this process issues such as data fragmentation, incompleteness, inaccessibility, aggregation, inconsistency, security and privacy are explored and addressed. Data accuracy is maximised through feedback loops between data capture methods, and use of verification tools.

## International academic partners 

The CCRP is a research-led programme designed to bring together researchers with similar research interests and values from across the globe. The CCRP works to provide a welcoming, open and stimulating space in which ideas and data can be shared. As well as operating within ethical frameworks set by individual research institutions, all CCRP partners sign up to its ethical framework and  protocols. CCCP partners use identical interfaces and main data category keypads to maximise clarity and interoperability of systems, to maintain programme and platform quality, and to maximise user trust. This is particularly important as software developer/engineers are actively encouraged to experiment with CCRP open code, and data are released with permission for third party use. Clear visual branding is also necessary to allow the purpose, principles, and quality of CCRP platforms to be instantly understood regardless of which country a Colouring Cities platform is operating in.  Where platforms differ is in additional subcategory inclusion relevant to national/regional contexts. 

CCRP academic partners can be identified by their inclusion on this page, and on the [Alan Turing Institute CCRP webpage](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/colouring-london-and-colouring-cities-research-programme).  No other applications of Colouring Cities open code, interface design or logo are endorsed.

## Background
The Colouring Cities Research Programme has been hosted by The Alan Turing Institute since 2020.  Between 2015 and 2019 it was based at Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London where the Colouring London prototype was built. The CCRP concept of free, multidisciplinary, knowledge exchange centres/systems (designed to help improve the sustainability of stocks, collaboratively built by diverse sectors, and maintained for public use at low cost), and of interactive mapping interfaces connected microspatial historical and current building attribute data, was first developed and tested by The Building Exploratory charitable trust in London in the late 1990s.
